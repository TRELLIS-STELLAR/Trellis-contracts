## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Cross-contract integration test suite covering full aid lifecycle, expiry flows, authorization boundaries, partial failure recovery, and referral commission distribution
- WASM size budget check in CI with per-contract limits and PR comments showing size deltas
- Automated API documentation publishing to GitHub Pages on every merge to main
- Improved crate-level rustdoc for all core contracts (aid, treasury, referral, oracle, registry)
- Landing page for API documentation explaining contract relationships and navigation

### Changed
- Enhanced rustdoc crate-level documentation with usage examples and cross-references
- Updated CI workflow to include WASM size measurement step

## [0.1.0] - 2024-09-24

### Added
- **Initial Release**: Complete Soroban smart contract suite for humanitarian aid distribution
- **Core Contracts**:
  - `aid-contract`: Direct aid settlement, escrow, and claim management
  - `treasury-contract`: Protocol treasury management with per-category balances and withdrawal limits
  - `referral-contract`: Multi-tier referral network with commission accrual and distribution
  - `governance-contract`: Multi-signature governance for role management and protocol upgrades
  - `oracle-contract`: Off-chain data integration and verification bridge
  - `registry-contract`: Central contract discovery and version tracking
  - `payments-contract`: Token transfer and payment settlement layer
  - `rebalancer-contract`: Liquidity rebalancing and reserve management
  - `nft-marketplace`: NFT minting, trading, and marketplace functionality
  - `access-control`: Role-based access control primitives
  - `upgradeability`: Centralized upgrade registry and coordinator

- **Shared Library**:
  - Error codes and event schemas
  - Storage helpers and authorization patterns
  - Batch transfer primitives for atomic multi-recipient payments
  - Persistent storage optimization (`persistent_read` for TTL-free reads)

- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Comprehensive test harness with mocks and helpers
  - Gas optimization benchmarking suite
  - Fuzzing harnesses for critical modules
  - Simulation tools for multi-user protocol activity

- **CI/CD**:
  - GitHub Actions workflows for build, clippy, test, and format checks
  - Automated test execution on push and pull requests

- **Documentation**:
  - GAS_OPTIMIZATION.md: Complete gas optimization guide with identified hotspots and benchmarks
  - UPGRADEABILITY.md: System-wide upgrade registry and coordinator documentation
  - Per-contract README files explaining module responsibilities and interfaces
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and contribution guidelines

- **Deployment Scripts**:
  - `scripts/deploy.sh`: Multi-contract deployment to testnet/mainnet
  - `scripts/initialize.sh`: Contract initialization utilities
  - `scripts/upgrade.sh`: Upgrade execution and management
  - `scripts/verify.sh`: Deployment verification tools
  - `scripts/register_upgradeable.sh`: Contract registration for upgrade system

### Key Features
- **Security**: Reentrancy protection, signature verification, overflow-safe arithmetic, access control, replay protection
- **Efficiency**: Gas optimizations for storage reads, validation ordering, event batching
- **Auditability**: Transparent transaction records, immutable event logs, comprehensive state tracking
- **Upgradeability**: Centralized upgrade registry with version tracking and history
- **Modularity**: Independent contracts with clear interfaces and cross-contract integration
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, edge case coverage, extensive testing

### Architecture
- Modular contract design with separation of concerns
- Shared library for common patterns and utilities
- Central registry for contract discovery and upgrade management
- Multi-signature governance for protocol changes
- Role-based access control across all contracts

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for all contract functions
- Integration tests for cross-contract flows
- Gas benchmarking tests for optimization verification
- Fuzzing tests for critical security-sensitive operations
- Simulation harnesses for multi-user scenarios

## Versioning Strategy

The Trellis Contracts project uses a hybrid versioning approach:

### Repository Version
- Follows Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Incremented when contract suite interfaces or behaviors change significantly
- Used for releases and documentation

### Individual Contract Versions
- Each contract tracks its own version in the upgradeability registry
- Allows independent contract updates without forcing suite-wide version bumps
- Critical for the on-chain upgrade system where contract identity is preserved across versions

See [UPGRADEABILITY.md](./UPGRADEABILITY.md) for details on the on-chain upgrade registry and version tracking.
