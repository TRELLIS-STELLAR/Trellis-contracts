# Overview

The **Trellis Contracts** repository contains every on-chain component responsible for securely executing humanitarian aid transactions on the Stellar blockchain using **Soroban**.

These contracts serve as the trust layer of the platform.

Instead of relying on centralized intermediaries, every payment, verification, referral reward, and settlement is executed transparently on-chain.

The contracts are designed to be:

- Secure
- Auditable
- Upgradeable
- Gas Efficient
- Modular
- Production Ready

---

# Why Smart Contracts?

Traditional donation systems rely heavily on centralized infrastructure.

Trellis replaces this model by executing critical operations directly on-chain.

The contracts provide:

- Transparent aid settlements
- Immutable transaction records
- Referral commission distribution
- Treasury management
- Multi-signature administration
- Emergency controls
- Upgrade governance

Every important financial action becomes publicly verifiable.

---

# Core Features

- Atomic transfers
- Escrow support
- Expiration handling
- Claim verification
- Replay protection

---

## Claim Links

## Treasury

Central treasury responsible for:

- Holding protocol reserves
- Reward distribution
- Administrative transfers
- Emergency withdrawals

---

- Emergency pause
- Role assignments

---

## Identity Verification

Stores verification references without exposing private user information.

Supports

- Hash verification
- Metadata pointers
- AI verification references
- Off-chain oracle integration

# Development Setup

## Install Rust

```
rustup update
```

Install Soroban CLI

```
cargo install --locked soroban-cli
```

Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/TRELLIS-STELLAR/Trellis.git

cd Trellis
```

---

# Build

```
cargo build --release
```

Build optimized WASM

```
cargo build \
--target wasm32v1-none \
--release
```

---

# Testing

Run all tests

```
cargo test
```

Run integration tests

```
cargo test --test integration
```

```
cargo llvm-cov
```

---

# Deployment

Deploy to Testnet

```
soroban contract deploy \
--wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/aid_contract.wasm \
--source admin
```

Initialize

```
soroban contract invoke \
--id CONTRACT_ID \
-- initialize
```

---

# Security

The contracts implement

- Reentrancy protection
- Signature verification
- Overflow-safe arithmetic
- Access control
- Replay protection
- Input validation
- Treasury limits
- Emergency pause
- Time-based expirations
- Storage validation

---

# Upgrade Strategy

Supports controlled upgrades through governance.

Only authorized administrators may:

- Upgrade contracts
- Register new implementations
- Pause protocol
- Resume protocol
- Update treasury
- Modify protocol parameters

---

# Storage Layout

Persistent storage includes

Aid Records

- Aid ID
- Donor
- Recipient
- Amount
- Status
- Timestamp

Referral Records

- Wallet
- Referrer
- Commission
- Tier

Treasury

- Balance
- Rewards
- Fees

Governance

- Admins
- Roles
- Versions
- Registry

---

# Events

Contracts emit events for:

AidCreated

AidClaimed

AidSettled

AidRefunded

CommissionPaid

TreasuryDeposit

TreasuryWithdrawal

ContractPaused

ContractResumed

ContractUpgraded

ModuleInitialized

ActionExecuted

PermissionChanged

Off-chain indexers should match the stable two-part topic tuples and decode the typed payloads documented in `shared/README.md`.

---
